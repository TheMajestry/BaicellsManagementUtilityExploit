# Baicells Management Utility Exploit

This is a Go script to check for and exploit the Baicells Management Utility vulnerability. It attempts to execute a specific command on the target if the vulnerability is found.

# Requirements

Golang  

# How to use 
1. git clone <this-git-url>
2. cd BaicellsManagementUtilityExploit
3. go build exploit.go
4. ./main <port> ex ./main 8080  -> Input the list of IP addresses or hostnames (one per line) to check and exploit.

# How It Works

The script works by performing the following steps for each provided IP address or hostname:

Sends an HTTP GET request to the target with the specified port.
Checks if the response status is "200 OK" and if the server header contains "Baicells Management Utility".
If the target is found vulnerable, it sends an HTTP POST request to the target's /utility/run_warn_command.sh endpoint, executing a specific command (command) on the target.
Checks if the command execution was successful by searching for a specific response message (exec_msg).
